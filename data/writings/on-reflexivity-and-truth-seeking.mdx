A note on Soros's [theory of reflexivity](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/uploads/9ae17912-2262-4646-8ffc-d01afc934c36/george-soros-general-theory-of-reflexivity-transcript.pdf) and a reminder to seek your own truth. 

#### fallibility & reflexivity
Soros supposes human fallibility: the proposition that every individual has a partial worldview. This is straightforward - no one knows everything.

Upon this, he introduces reflexivity, which has to do with the process of thinking. 
We can imagine thinking as two things: a cognitive and a manipulative function. 
The cognitive function is how we perceive things, with the direction of causation being from world to mind. 
For example, my perception of a cup of water is caused by the cup of water's existence in the external world. 

The manipulative function is simply the opposite.
It is how our intentions affect the world, and thus the direction of causation is from mind to world.
Extending our example, the cup's emptiness is caused by my intention to drink the cup of water.
It is much like reading and writing to state. 

Reflexivity is what happens when these two functions operate in tandem.
The output of one function becomes the input to the other, and voila, we have a feedback loop. This loop becomes problematic because we lose our grasp on ground truth very quickly.

If Jerome Powell says, "It's sunny today," that statement is verifiably true or false. 
If Jerome Powell says, "We are screwed," that statement is reflexive. 
The markets will likely crash regardless of the "true" state of the economy. 

#### so what?
The power of reflexivity becomes obvious when we view society as a game with rules. 
Upon closer inspection, many of these rules start to seem arbitrary. 
For instance, to what extent do we attempt to act rational simply because the economic theory drilled in to us champions rationality? 
And to what extent is economics a social science yearning for the lawful rigor of a natural science? 
As it is obvious humans are not perfectly rational, we now settle for the term "boundedly rational", which is, by Popper's account, [unfalsifiable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)

We like to think that, over time, our ideas and approaches have progressed. That we are getting closer to the truth. 
This may or may not be the case. What is undeniable, however, is that a non-trivial portion of our behavior is an incarnation of well-known theories and dogma.

This is why institutions like the Nobel Foundation and disciplines like economics are so powerful. 
Someone proposes a theory that for one reason or another is favored. 
Fast forward to a decade later, and the theory is treated as a baseline assumption. 
Beliefs about how we *should* act become how we really *do* act. 

Society, culture, science, religion - all things we like to think of as foundational - are malleable feedback loops, and problems arise when we don't fully recognize this. Convention doesn't equate to truth. 

It's always better to do your own thinking. Rules are only what you make of them.
